## 💬 Reflection

EasyShopper began as a class project and grew into a complete full-stack app with real hosting and a working database.
Through it, I learned how to:

-Deploy full-stack apps using Render + Netlify

-Manage CORS, environment variables, and SSL

-Handle React Router in production builds

-Debug authentication and database issues

-Connect the dots between frontend UX and backend logic

It’s not a commercial product — it’s a proof of skill project demonstrating end-to-end execution.
